The garden at Buckingham Palace is situated behind the building 
of Buckingham Palace. Compared to other private Gardens in London 
it occupies the largest area. Notable features include a large 
19th-century lake which is graced by a flock of flamingoes, and 
the Waterloo Vase. In the garden there is a summerhouse, a helicopter 
pad, and a tennis court. Unlike the nearby Royal Parks of London, 
Buckingham Palace Garden is not usually open to the public. However 
when Buckingham Palace is open during August and September, visitors 
have access to part of the garden, which forms the exit from the 
palace at the end of the tour.
