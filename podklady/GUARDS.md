Queen's Guards
==============

[[IMG:guard-changing.jpg]]

The Queen's Guards stay at their posts for two hours period. 
Every 10 minutes guards leave their sentry boxes and does a 
march. Each sentry will do this four to five times before 
halting. He will then shoulder arms and stand at ease. 
Standing "easy" is not permitted whilst a sentry is at post.

In fact, they are not purely ceremonial but they are fully 
operational soldiers.
