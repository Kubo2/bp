Buckingham Palace is the official London residence and principal workplace of the British monarch. Located in the City of Westminster, the palace is often at the centre of state occasions and welcomming the royal guests.

Originally known as Buckingham House, the building which forms the core of today's palace was a large townhouse built for the Duke of Buckingham in 1705 on a site which had been in private ownership for at least 150 years.

Buckingham Palace finally became the official royal palace of the British monarch on the accession of Queen Victoria in 1837
